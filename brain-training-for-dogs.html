<br/>
<p>As a professional dog trainer, I've seen the nuts and bolts of pretty much all the dog training programs available online.  </p>
<br/>
<p>And quite honestly, most are garbage, while some are unsafe and downright cruel, to say the least.</p>
<br/>
<p>But today, I'm going to share with you my professional review of Brain Training for Dogs.</p>
<br/>
<p>Because as a professional, I feel that it's an excellent program, offering good value for money and above all – nothing but positive reinforcement methods!</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>I've seen the inside of Brain Training for Dogs and before I got certified in dog training, this was my go-to program for my own dogs.</p></strong>
<br/>
<p>In fact, Adrienne Faricelli is one of my dog training idols and a big driving factor in my choice to be a professional dog trainer.</p>
<br/>
<p>In a nutshell, she is an inspiration and I can vouch for her training methods and philosophy.</p>
<br/>
<p>In this review, you'll learn about what you get with her program, what expectations you can have and to ensure I'm not biased, I'll talk about what I'd like to see improved.</p>
<br/>
<p>And just for fun, I'll show you a quick video of my dog and me training for one of the basic games – which can be used for an unlimited amount of training in the future.</p>
<br/>
<p>The fact that you are here, reading this means you want to do the best you can for your dog.</p>
<br/>
<p>So grab a cup or glass of your favorite beverage, turn your phone off, and enjoy reading this review from beginning to end. </p>

<p><center><strong>Brain Training for Dogs Review</p></center></strong>
<br/>
Brain Training for Dogs is a force-free training program. That's affordable for any dog-guardian to buy into and apply to their at-home dog training.
<br/><br/>
<p><strong>So what does that mean?</p></strong>
<br/>
<p>Well, in a nutshell, by using Adrienne's program you will use positive reinforcement methods to train your dog.</p>
<p><br/>
This is a clear distinction from dominance or punishment-based training, where dogs behave to avoid punishment.</p>
<br/>
<p>If you don't know this already, dominance training causes;</p>
<p></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Destroys trust between you and your dog.</li>
<li>Damages your dog's confidence and can lead to learned helplessness.</li>
<li>Grinds learning down to a halt.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Positive reinforcement, on the other hand, helps you fulfill your duty as a dog guardian by teaching YOU how to set your dog up for success in every training session.</p></strong>
<br />
<p>Here's how…</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>You'll learn how to intentionally create a positive learning environment</li>
<li>Your dog will learn problem-solving skills.</li>
<li>You'll have a dog who wants and craves to actively train with you.</li>
<li>You and your dog will experience high-speed learning because of positive reinforcement.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<br />
<p>In this review of Brain Training for Dogs, you'll get to know the nuts and bolts that a Professional Dog Trainer who wants to work positively with a dog expects from a training program.</p>
<br />
<p>And you'll get a peek into how the program benefitted me and my dogs (long before I was a Professional Dog Trainer), so you can make an informed decision about using the program to train your own dog.</p>
<br />
<p>And I believe at the end of it all you'll know why it's one of the best and most affordable options online.</p>
<br />
<p>But first, there's something you should know.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Who Will Benefit from the Braining Training for Dogs Course?</p></strong>
<br />
<p>The folks who will benefit the most from this course are folks who:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Enjoy independent learning.</li><li>Prefer working at their own pace.</li><li>Don't need or want to know all the geeky science stuff that makes these methods work.</li></ul><p></p>
<br />
<p>If on the other hand, you prefer to work one-on-one or in small groups with the live guidance of a professional by your side, this course might not be what you're looking for.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>What You Get Inside Brain Training for Dogs?</p></strong>
<br />
<p>I began my relationship with Brain Training for Dogs early in 2017 and since then, Adrienne has continued to develop and improve her course.</p>
<br />
<p>While at the same time, ensuring it is affordable and accessible.</p>
<br />
<p>And right now, the course is available for a time fee of $47, plus any taxes. You won't incur any extra monthly fees either.</p>
<br />
<p>When I penned my review in early 2017, one of the things I wanted to see (and mentioned in my original review) was an exclusive member's area.</p>
<br />
<p>I'm pleased beyond belief to report that Adrienne and her team have retooled the course!  And now, if you're an owner of the course, you have access to an exclusive member's area.</p>
<br />
<p>Not only that but now following along with the training is even more simple! Because each step of the course has its own description of what you need to do with a corresponding video.</p>
<br />
<p>You still get state-of-the-art, positive dog training information in the ebooks and short videos that were always available.</p>
<br />
<p>But now they are offered in a user-friendly member's area. </p>
<br />
<p>The reason I like this change so much is that following along with the videos and written information meets the needs of people with different learning styles.</p>
<br />
<p>And that's not all, there's more! Much more<p>
<br />
<p>The course is still as information-rich as ever but now you have access to things like:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Case Studies.</li><li>Ask Adrienne (where you can direct questions that Adrienne or her expert team will answer).</li><li>In-depth case studies on how Adrienne's training methods have worked for different dogs.</li></ul><p></p><p><br /></p>
<p>You can log into the member's area from your phone, tablet, or laptop.  So as long as you have a reliable internet connection and your dog nearby – you can learn and train on the fly.</p>
<br />
<p>I'm especially happy about the community forum and the case studies.  The forum is a newer edition, and I highly encourage you to register and dive into discussions.</p>
<br />
<p>The number of case studies has also increased, which shows that Adrienne and her team are actively engaged and improving the learning environment for students.</p>
<br />
<p>The first case study was of Sadie who Adrienne helped overcome pacing and whining behaviors. This is super important when you consider that Sadie was in training to be a service dog.</p>
<br />
<p>Next up we have Maggie, who came to Adrienne's cageless board and train facility with a serious jumping behavior issue.</p>
<br />
<p>And Homer is the rescue Golden Retriever who Adrienne helps overcome a range of issues such as lunging, resource guarding, and overall reactivity.</p>
<br />
<p>These case studies focus on showing regular dog guardians that positive reinforcement is the most effective way to teach our dogs what we want them to do instead.</p>
<br />
<p>And they also break down the basics of how you can help your dog overcome their unwanted behaviors in a positive and force-free way.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Brain Training for Dogs Bonuses</p></strong>
<br />
<p>As a part of the bonuses, you'll get access to 9 training videos to teach your dog fun tricks that can also be show stoppers!</p>
<br />
<p>Use these to show off your abilities as a dog trainer and your dog's amazing brain capacity!</p>
<br />
<p>Talk about a confidence boost for both of you!</p>
<br />
<p>Here are just some of the tricks you'll learn to teach</p>
<p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Take a Bow</li><li>Dance</li><li>Shake hands</li><li>Howl</li><li>Speak (Excellent for barky dogs!)</li><li>Rollover (Awesome for grooming requirements)</li><li>Play dead</li></ol><div><br /></div><p></p>
<p><strong>What's the Cost of Braining Training for Dogs</p></strong>
<br />
<p>Right now, the course is still selling at $47 once off (with applicable taxes). And that's will all the upgrades and bonuses included – there are zero upsells!</p>
<br />
<p>An absolute steal considering what's included and how effective this type of training is. And the amount of information Adrienne provides is hard to rival.</p>
<br />
<p>I've had a relationship with Adrienne and her team for going on 4.5 years and they have mentioned that they might start charging monthly. </p>
<br />
<p>So I encourage you to jump on board before that happens!</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Adrienne's Philosophy as a Trainer</p></strong>
<br />
<p>I've personally had many conversations with Adrienne and her team, so I can tell you first-hand that Adrienne's philosophy is force-free, kind, and science-based.</p>
<br />
<p>You'll learn first-hand from a highly skilled trainer how you can use positive reinforcement to train your dog. This is an effective powerful way to train.</p>
<br />
<p>Essentially creating a winning relationship between you and your dog.</p>
<br />
<p>Why?</p>
<br />
<p>Well, it not only boosts the dog-human bond but also creates an environment of success. And dogs respond incredibly well to success – even if the wins are small!</p>
<br />
<p>The best part for me as a professional dog trainer is that this course can be used with dogs of all ages!</p>
<br />
<p>Whether you have an 8-week old puppy or an 8-year-old dog – it'll work for pups to gray-muzzled seniors.</p>
<br />
<p>Adrienne’s methods will grow, skill-develop, and challenge both you and your dog physically and mentally.</p>
<br />
<p>The training exercises are forward-thinking and progressive games and puzzles that your dog will need to figure out. </p>
<br />
<p>This might sound simple enough, but the power of learning lies in the simplest of games!</p>
<br />
<p>There is going to be a learning curve.  But keep in mind, dog training is not a sprint – it's a marathon!</p>
<br />
<p>The goal is to develop your dog's mental agility and skills across many different areas.</p>
<br />
<p>And if you're concerned about using food as rewards – don't be!</p>
<br />
<p>Adrienne dives into how to fade food as a reward for skills your dog has mastred and how to begin using other rewards like toys and life-rewards as reinforcement.</p>
<br />
<p>But just to set your mind at ease, remember that a reward (whether food, toys, or activities) is a reward for a job well done – not a bribe!</p>
<br />
<p>It's payment for learning and getting it right!</p>
<br />
<p>There are 21 exercises in total and Adrienne makes sure to include troubleshooting guides with each one.</p>
<br />
<p>Something that I know as a Professional Dog Training is super important to help dogs and their humans learn.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Adrienne Faricelli’s Professional Credentials</p></strong>
<br />
<p>Adrienne has worked with dogs professionally for over 14 years. And she's a is a certified dog trainer and behavior consultant.</p>
<br />
<p>She also specializes in working with dogs who are intended to work as service or therapy dogs.  And considering the kind of responsibility placed on service dogs especially, it's <p>clear that Adrienne is a trusted, revered and exceptional trainer.</p>
<br />
<p>She holds dual certification in dog training both in Italy (with the Italian Association for Dog Trainers and Canine Consultants) as well as in the United States (where she is certified CPDT-KA).</p>
<br />
<p>Adrienne's work can also be found widely in both print and online. And she has been featured extensively in;</p>
<p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>USA Today</li><li>Daily Puppy</li><li>Nest Pets</li><li>Paw Nation</li><li>And E-how</li><li>Every Dog magazine</li><li>And the APDT Chronicle of the Dog.</li></ol><p></p>
<p>So as one of her students, you can be assured that she knows her stuff, and won't teach your bad techniques!</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Training You, the Dog Owner</p></strong>
<br />
<p>SAs a dog guardian, you might not be aware of this, but the truth about dog training is, it's more about teaching people how to train their dogs.</p>
<br />
<p>SThink about it, if you know the basic principles, you can teach your dog anything!</p>
<br />
<p>SAnd so, I love how Adrienne's course gives clear instructions on concepts and techniques. </p>
<br />
<p>SMaking it super simple for YOU to follow along and learn – and become an excellent trainer for your dog.</p>
<br />
<p>SYou and your dog are not robots – you're both one-of-a-kinds! And so this means that training doesn't always go smoothly.</p>
<br />
<p>SI know I touched on the in-depth troubleshooting sections earlier, but it's worth mentioning again.</p>
<br />
<p>SAs a professional dog trainer, I know the value of being able to figure out bumps in the training road. And how vital this is for supporting the canine-human bond.</p>
<br />
<p>SThe course will also guide you in mastering clicker training. And believe me, learning to clicker train is a skill not to be underestimated!</p>
<br />
<p>SIf you're new to clicker training, think of it as a very precise tool to use when training a behavior. Kind of like a surgeon needing to use a using a scalpel during surgery.</p>
<br />
<p>SDuring the course you'll also get the basics of treat delivery, learning the best way to hold and deliver treats will save your fingers in the long run!</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Polishing Up Your Training</p></strong>
<p>Adrienne has gone to great lengths to give you all the tools you need to round up your training as though you are working with a trainer one-on-one.</p><p>She deals with things that are often overlooked and that can end up causing your dog to only listen when it suits them.</p><p>Below are just a few of the crucial secrets she shares in her training program.</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Fading food lures, so your dog doesn't become dependent on treats.</li><li>Simplifying hand signals, and taking the mystery out of teaching them.</li><li>Adding verbal cues, at the right time to avoid causing confusion if you add them too soon.</li><li>Hand signals vs. verbal cues, when and how to use them successfully.</li><li>Fading continuous rewards, so your dog reliably offers any behavior even without the presence of rewards.</li></ol><p></p><p>It's worth remembering that training your dog is a joint venture. It is a give and take activity that is a great bonding experience for you and your pooch.</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>It also strengthens your dog’s trust in you.</li><li>It's fun.</li><li>You'll spend some of the best quality time with your dog.</li><li>And your dog will learn faster with this training method.</li></ol><p></p><p><br /></p>
<p><b>What You'll Need to Follow Brain Training for Dogs</b></p><p>Brain Training for Dogs does require a few supplies. But most of them are free and can be found in your home. So you won't need to spend a fortune to get started.</p><p><br /></p><p>The first thing you'll learn is that in a reward-based training system, not all food is created equal!</p><p><br /></p><p>Kibble is one thing, but yummy, cooked chicken is another.</p><p><br /></p><p>There is also a difference between small, quick-chew, and larger treats. Both kinds are important and Adrienne shows you which to use and when.</p><p><br /></p><p>Other items include a clicker. Adrienne suggests that you can use a verbal marker rather than a clicker. Personally, I use both. But I trained clicker first and later verbal.</p><p><br /></p><p>But do yourself a favor and get a clicker. For about a buck, this is an invaluable tool, and I strongly recommend that you buy one. I actually have about 20 of them around my house.</p><p><br /></p><p>Other items include muffin tins, rugs, and plastic bottles. A treat bag is also handy, a pointer and a stopwatch, but I just use my smartphone for this one.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Here's a quick breakdown.</b></p><p><b>Introduction</b> – Here you'll see what supplies you need and what your objective is.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>How to train</b> – Here you'll learn step-by-step how to train your dog the behavior.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Troubleshooting problems</b> – If you're experiencing a bump in the road, this is where Adrienne shows you what you are doing wrong and how to fix it.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Increasing the challenge</b> – Here's where you learn to reinforce the behavior and make it a transferable skill.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>The exam</b> – Now you're ready to test your dog's skill and evaluate how well your pooch is doing!</p><p><br /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Obedience 101</b></p><p>Brain Training for Dogs starts with an introductory Obedience section.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Don't skip this part!</b></p><p><br /></p><p>It's the most important part of the training program because here's where you teach your dog basic obedience commands.</p><p><br /></p><p>Without this foundation, you and your dog will fail at everything else.</p><p><br /></p><p>Some of the most essential things you'll both learn are;</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Using a lure</li><li>Sit</li><li>Lie down</li><li>Take / leave it</li><li>Drop it</li><li>Stay</li><li>Recall (AKA Come)</li><li>Heeling</li></ol><p></p><p><br /></p>

<p>These commands a vital part of the later brain games.</p><p><br /></p><p>Also, they are healthy behaviors that will make you and your dog happier.</p><p><br /></p><p>Imagine this…</p><p><br /></p><p>You find your dog on the verge of munching away at a poisonous mushroom they found in the woods.&nbsp; Untrained dogs will likely wolf down that mushroom before their owner can reach them to take it away.</p><p><br /></p><p>But if your dog knows the “drop it” command, you can be 100% sure they'll drop that mushroom like a hot potato!</p><p><br /></p><p>Now imagine this…</p><p><br /></p><p>Your dog is moving at breakneck speed towards a busy road in pursuit of a squirrel.&nbsp; If your dog is not 100% trained in a recall, you're going to have 10 different sorts of trouble on your hands.</p><p><br /></p><p>But, if your pooch knows when you recall everything else but you disappears, you have 100% control of the environment.&nbsp; No matter where your dog is or what distractions there are.</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm sure you'll agree this is a very powerful skill for you and your dog.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Pre-School to Einstein</b></p><p>Brain Training for Dogs is set up in a school-like structure. The exercises and puzzles become more challenging as the program progresses. Levels include:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Preschool – Very easy</li><li>Elementary – Easy</li><li>High School – Intermediate</li><li>College – Difficult</li><li>University – Very difficult</li><li>Graduation – Expert</li><li>Einstein – Genius</li></ul><p></p><p>At the end of each task, you grade your dog anywhere from A-F. The grade is based on how fast your dog completes the challenge.</p><p><br /></p><p>Each exam has it’s own grading curve. And each level has its own criteria for what grades will allow your dog to progress to the next level.</p><p><br /></p><p>Once you and your dog have mastered a lesson, there are suggestions to “up the game.”</p><p><br /></p><p>This reinforces what your dog learns, and also makes your dog more fluid at the task.&nbsp; Which means they will start using their skill in other ways and situations.</p><p><br /></p><p>For example, once you have taught your dog to lie down, you can then teach them to lie down while you're eating, while there are strangers in the house, or while you are preparing his meal.</p><p><br /></p><p>Adrienne suggests that you can pick and choose the exercises at random. But I recommend that you follow the program in sequence.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is because each exercise builds skills that are helpful in successfully completing the next level.</p><p><br /></p><p>Also, some great advice is that if your dog starts to slip or needs a little reinforcement, you can always revisit an earlier lesson.</p><p><br /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b></b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Force-Free Dog Training</b></p><p>In this part of my review, I'll breakdown the first 2 lessons in the program at the Preschool level.&nbsp; You'll see just how amazing force-free training is and what you and your dog can accomplish.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Lesson 1 – Targeting</p><p><b>Objective:</b></p><p>Your dog must touch a target object with his nose on cue.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>What you need:</b></p><p>A target like a pointer with a large blunt end or a Post-it note.</p><p><br /></p><p>A clicker and treats.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Goal:</b></p><p>The larger goal is that this exercise teaches your dog to look to you for guidance. It also increases your dog’s self-esteem.&nbsp; Which is awesome in itself!</p><p><br /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>The Method:</b></p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Have your dog touch your hand with his nose.</li><li>The first time he does this, you hide your hand, click, and reward him. It is vitally important that he hears the click the instant his nose touches your palm.</li><li>You repeat this exercise several times without adding a cue.</li><li>Once he has the hang of it, you name the behavior by adding a cue.</li><li>Use a word like “target,” present your hand, click, reward, repeat.</li><li>Once your dog has mastered this, you can present a different target like a Post-it note. This is how you transfer the skill as I mentioned earlier.</li></ol><p></p><p>The troubleshooting section is where this program really excels. Suggestions for a dog who has problems learning this skill include ideas like; breaking it down into smaller tasks. Or, increasing the value of the treats.</p><p><br /></p>

<p><b>Increasing the challenge is where it gets fun!</b></p><p>Now you teach your dog to touch Post-it notes with his paw. The Post-it can be placed on the floor, the walls, furniture, light switches. You can actually teach your dog how to turn the lights on and off.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Totally cool!</b></p><p>Here's a short video my dog and I made about targeting</p><p><br /></p>

<p>The exam is where you put your dog to the test.</p><p><br /></p><p>You start the timer and have your dog touch your hand, or the target stick or a Post-it note three times in quick succession.</p><p><br /></p><p>It can be with his nose or his paw, his preference. Check the time after the third touch, and there you have it! Passing grades for this challenge is 3 C's.</p><p><br /></p><p>Adrienne reckons your pooch will need to complete 3 executions in less than 17 seconds to make the passing grade.</p><p><br /></p><p>The video shows you how to conduct the exam. But, more importantly, it shows you how to use the clicker and treat to reward your dog.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you have never done clicker training, I pay very close attention to how Adrienne uses the clicker and treats.</p><p><br /></p><p>It might look easy but handling a clicker, treats, and an object while training is a skill to learn.</p><p><br /></p><p>It takes some practice to master the skill, but you and your dog are lost without it.</p>
<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Lesson 2 – Look into my eyes</b></p><p>In my opinion, this is one of those behaviors up there with emergency recall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>If your dog can focus on you on tap, you'll be in a position to avoid some dangerous situations.&nbsp; Think dog fights and road accidents here…</p><p><br /></p><p>I wrote about how useful this behavior is when dealing with an unruly pooch.</p><p><br /></p><p>Here's how it goes down…</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Objective:</b></p><p>Your dog must look into your eyes on cue.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>What you need:</b></p><p>A clicker and treats.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Goal:</b></p><p>To open the lines of communication between you and your dog and to promote trust and bonding.</p><p><br /></p><p>Making eye contact is an important basic skill. When your dog looks into your eyes, he will find it easier to focus and follow directions.</p><p><br /></p><p>Once your dog masters this skill, you can divert your dog’s attention from other dogs or situations where he becomes nervous.</p><p><br /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>The Method:</b></p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Here you will find using a noise that your dog will respond to. Adrienne suggests a smacking sound – like kissing air – to get your dog’s attention.</li><li>Begin by holding a treat next to your eyes and making the kissing sound. As soon as the dog looks in your eyes, click, reward, repeat.</li></ol><p></p><p><br /></p>

<p><b>Tip: Do this exercise in a quiet room.</b></p><p>In the troubleshooting problems section, Adrienne shows you how to associate the kissing sound with a treat.</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Make a kissing sound and immediately toss a treat. Do this several times.</li><li>Once you have established the kissing sound as desirable, begin rewarding even fleeting glances. Oh, so romantic!</li><li>As you continue, only reward longer and longer glances. Adrienne breaks down many of the skills into a group of smaller skills throughout the program.</li></ol><p></p><p><br /></p>

<p>This approach is very effective, especially with timid dogs, dogs learn slower or previously abused dogs.</p><p><br /></p><p>In increasing the challenge, Adrienne suggests training your dog to hold your gaze for longer. You do this by delaying the click and treat.</p><p><br /></p><p>You can also work in a place with more distractions, and hold your gaze while you are walking. This last is called “attention heeling.”</p><p><br /></p><p>She stresses that it is important to stop using the treat at eye level as soon as you can. This is called “fading the lure.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>If you don't do this at the right time, you'll have a dog that won't do anything unless there are treats around.</p><p><br /></p><p>That's not what you want!</p><p><br /></p><p>The exam is 3 “look into my eyes” in rapid succession. You can use the lure at eye level, or not if your dog will perform this behavior without it.</p><p><br /></p><p>As soon as your dog looks into your eyes, you click and reward. As always, the exercise is timed.</p><p><br /></p><p>The exam video will show you exactly how to perform the exercise, and how your dog should respond.</p>

<p><b>More Advanced Brain Train Games</b></p><p>The training exercises at the most advanced level get more interesting. Not to mention really fun!</p><p><br /></p><p>As always, the objective of each exercise is to have your dog learn a new, desirable behavior.</p><p><br /></p><p>Throughout this training program, there is always a broader purpose to the exercises that positively impacts your dog’s quality of life!</p><p><br /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>A few of these advanced exercises are:</b></p><p><b>Leg weaving</b> – Your dog must weave through your legs. This is a great bonding exercise, because of the physical closeness. This exercise is also great to teach smaller dogs not to be afraid of your legs and feet!</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Name discrimination</b> – The objective of this exercise is to teach your dog the names of several different toys. And bring you a specific toy by name. This is great to extend your dog’s cognitive abilities – dogs can learn up to 200 vocabulary words.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>The tidy up game </b>– I LOVE this exercise. You teach your dog to pick up their toys and put them in a specific place! If he could only fold laundry!</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Play the piano</b> – This exercise is a natural conclusion to Brain Training for Dogs. In this exercise, you teach your dog to “target” several notes in sequence on a piano or electric keyboard. That’s quite a party trick!</p><p><br /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Behavior Training for Dogs: Examples</b></p><p>Behavior Training for Dogs is the second book that comes as a free bonus. This is the next area that I will explore in my review of Adrienne's Brain Training for Dogs.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the second book, Adrienne teaches you how to remedy some common behavioral issues.</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Whining</li><li>Barking</li><li>Digging</li><li>Chewing</li><li>Jumping</li></ol><p></p><p>So let's look at 2 of the most common problems pooch parents face…</p><p><br /></p><p>Attention seeking whining and barking at nothing.</p><p><br /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Attention Seeking Whining</b></p><p>Adrienne explains that whining is an instinctive behavior pups use to speak to mom.</p><p><br /></p><p>They are born blind, deaf, and unable to regulate their own temperatures.</p><p><br /></p><p>So they need some way to tell their mom that they are hungry or cold. Once the puppies are weaned, their mothers become deaf to their whining and the behavior goes away.</p><p><br /></p><p>When a puppy goes to their new home at about 8 weeks old, it can be distressing. So whining is a way to get your attention.</p><p><br /></p><p>For the puppy, this is a proven method that works. In the past, whining was positively enforced. Because mom responded with warm snuggles and food.</p><p><br /></p><p>There are a few reasons that dogs whine. So it's important to figure out the root cause before you begin to train the behavior out of your dog.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Dogs may whine because;</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>They are anxious.</li><li>To get attention.</li><li>Or because they are excited.</li></ol><p></p><p>The problem is when the line between whining for a real need – like food or water. And whining for attention becomes blurred.</p><p><br /></p><p>And guess what? This is usually the owner’s fault for unwittingly positively reinforcing the behavior!</p><p><br /></p><p>A long time ago, when I was new to dog training, I learned from many of my dog training idols that…</p><p><br /></p><p>And dogs aren’t like us.</p><p><br /></p><p>We can make a distinction between positive and negative attention.</p><p><br /></p><p>Dog's can't.</p><p><br /></p><p>So, if we scold our dogs, we see this as negative attention.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is how your dog sees it…</p><p><br /></p><p>Whining + scolding = attention.</p><p><br /></p><p>So, who’s training who here?</p><p><br /></p><p>Adrienne teaches you that behaviors that are reinforced grow stronger.</p><p><br /></p><p>And behaviors that are ignored go away.</p><p><br /></p>

<p><b>This is a restatement of Thorndike’s Law of Effect.</b></p><p></p><blockquote>Responses that produce a satisfying effect in a particular situation become more likely to occur again in that situation, and responses that produce a discomforting effect become less likely to occur again in that situation.</blockquote><p></p><p>So if your dog is whining for attention, you simply ignore them at all costs.</p><p><br /></p><p>As soon as the whining stops, you reward them with play, treats or a toy.</p><p><br /></p><p>So, for example, you are vacuuming the house and you crate your dog.</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Your dog whines.</li><li>Ignore him.</li><li>Finish vacuuming.</li><li>Once you are done, if your dog is still whining, ignore them. Don’t look at or talk to them. And don’t let them out of their crate.</li><li>The second the whining stops, let them hear you coming toward the crate.</li><li>If they start whining again, stop dead in your tracks. Once they are quiet again, continue toward the crate, release and reward them.</li></ol><p></p><p>Here's another example…</p><p><br /></p><p>If you are in a room with your dog and they start whining, turn your back.</p><p><br /></p><p>When they stop whining, turn back toward them.</p><p><br /></p><p>If not, turn around and start to leave the room. Any attention, even looking at your dog when they're whining, is positive reinforcement.</p><p><br /></p><p>Yes, it sounds like the long way around. But it's also the best way!</p><p><br /></p><p>If you behave consistently to change this annoying behavior…</p><p><br /></p><p>You will be rewarded with a whine-free dog!</p><p><br /></p><p>Remember back at the beginning of this Brain Training for Dogs review I mentioned how dog training is also about people training?</p><p><br /></p><p>Now you've seen the proof!</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Barking at Nothing</b></p><p>It’s normal for our dogs to bark. When barking gets out of hand, it can be very unpleasant for us.</p><p><br /></p><p>I mean I got a comment on this blog from a guy at 3 am in the morning. His dog was keeping him up at night. And he was getting complaints from the neighbors.</p><p><br /></p><p>Not a fun situation to be in! Right?</p><p><br /></p><p>Although we like to think that our dogs are barking at nothing, that is most likely NOT the case.</p><p><br /></p><p>Dogs have senses of hearing and smell that totally outstrip our own. So if they appear to be barking at nothing, they are most likely barking as something that we are not aware of.</p><p><br /></p><p>Examples include:</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Barking at pests</b> – This usually happens at night. If you suspect your dog of barking, for this reason, call an exterminator.</p><p><br /></p><p>Tip: You can also try distracting him with a fan, television, or radio to drown out the other animal sounds.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Distant sounds</b> – Dogs may hear other dogs or sirens that are too far away for us to hear.</p><p><br /></p><p>Adrienne suggests keeping your dog away from the windows or using something that makes a noise like a fan or a radio to distract them from the noise.</p><p><br /></p><p>Reinforcement – Like whining for attention, dogs can bark for your attention.</p><p><br /></p><p>If your dog is looking at you when he barks, and you respond, you are reinforcing that behavior.</p><p><br /></p><p>The same technique of completely ignoring them and leaving the room is used to remedy this situation.</p><p><br /></p><p>Adrienne also suggests that your dog could be bored. So, playing a game -like the ones found in Brain Training for Dogs – provides mental stimulation. Is a great way to distract your dog and work on reconditioning the barking behavior.</p><p><br /></p><p>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) – Some dogs bark at nothing because they suffer from OCD.</p><p><br /></p><p>Their barking is prolonged, exaggerated, and out of context. These are usually high-strung pooches who suffer from anxiety. And some breeds are more prone to OCD than others. A lot of mixed breeds fall into this category.</p><p><br /></p><p>The best course of action is to talk to your vet.</p><p><br /></p><p>On a personal note, Lexi my GSD-Collie cross is an OCD barker.&nbsp; I have no real information about her background since she is a rescue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>But I do know she came from terrible circumstances which might have lead to this obsessive behavior.</p><p><br /></p><p>After trying everything, my vet recently started treating her with Clomicalm. Which is a calming drug specifically designed for dogs.</p><p><br /></p><p>I've seen a marked change in her behavior. And her little heart no longer races at a million miles an hour so her well-being and quality of life has improved.&nbsp; Which is all I want.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Dementia</b> – This usually occurs in older dogs. It's also known as Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (CCD). And it's like Alzheimer’s disease in humans.</p><p><br /></p><p>Behavior changes include altered sleep patterns, pacing or wandering. Also, staring at walls, barking, and whining. And even losing their potty training skills and not responding to their cues.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is a progressive disease, but there are some drugs that may slow the progress of the disease. This is another one of those “talk to your vet” situations.</p><p><br /></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>More Behavior Topics in Behavior Training for Dogs</b></p><p>The three other chapters in Behavior Training for Dogs are:</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Digging</b> – Dogs dig for many reasons. Some dogs, like Terriers, are bred to dig. While others dig to have a cool place to lie down. Or to escape, or to whelp puppies.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Chewing </b>– Dogs chew on things they’re not supposed to for several reasons. Puppies teethe, boredom, attention-seeking, anxiety, or loneliness. Many of the items that your dog finds attractive to chew have your odor all over them. Adrienne gives some great tips and advice on how to deal with chewing.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Jumping</b> – Dogs jump as a part of their greeting ritual. When they are puppies they jump up to get closer to us when they greet us. We positively reinforce the behavior because we’re equally happy to see them. Our puppies grow up, and when they reach 80 pounds, jumping is already a huge problem.</p><p><br /></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>What Needs Improving</b></p><p>Okay, so now I've shared everything I like about Brain Training for Dogs.</p><p><br /></p><p>But, we all know nothing is perfect.&nbsp; So here are a few things I'd like to see improved on…</p><p><br /></p><p>Okay, so you already know I love the videos in this program.&nbsp; What I would like to see is better sound quality.&nbsp; It's not that you can't hear what Adrienne's saying, but the sound is a little muddy.</p><p><br /></p><p>I'd also love to see an exclusive member's area where all the videos, e-books and updated information can be found in one place.</p><p><br /></p><p>And an online community would be a super addition.</p><p><br /></p><p>Update: Adrienne and her team have now included a forum inside the member's area. I love this addition and I'm so pleased to see Adrienne listening to what her students need! It just goes to show how dedicated she is to bettering the lives of dogs and their humans through the power of games.</p><p><br /></p><p>It would be helpful to discuss the contents of this program with other newcomers to dog training.&nbsp; for example, I might be struggling with something you have found the solution to.&nbsp; So it would be great to bounce ideas off other pooch parents.&nbsp; And maybe even share videos.</p><p><br /></p><p>Adrienne does give members direct access to her email and says that she tries to answer every email personally, which is above and beyond the call of duty.</p><p><br /></p><p>So, after reading my Brain Training for Dogs review should you buy the program?</p><p><br /></p><p>As a professional dog trainer and a dog owner who has used this program extensively for several years, I can wholeheartedly say yes!</p><p><br /></p><p>At a cost of $47 USD, I can't tell you what a bargain it is.</p><p><br /></p><p>I mean, on average you'll be shelling out anywhere from $125 to $175 per hour for a dog trainer!</p><p><br /></p><p>But besides the price, I support Adrienne's Brain Training for Dogs for more important reasons</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>The training methods are force-free, science-based and kind.</li><li>The unique connection between behavior and brain-boosting games will inspire you and your dog to do more.</li><li>Adrienne Faricelli is a highly qualified expert in the field of canine behavior.

Right?</p><p><br /></p><p>So I reached out to Adrienne and asked for an interview so that you can get to know her better. In this interview you'll read about:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>How Adrienne started out and her credentials.</li><li>How her creative training style will help you overcome any behavior issues.</li><li>Why she refused to re-home one of her pups, even after dog training experts advised her to.</li><li>Why brain training exercises stimulate the working gene in your pooch.</li><li>Advice on what to do when training isn't going according to plan.</li><li>And some great ways you can build trust and bond with your hound.</li></ol><p></p><p><br /></p><p>So I’m pretty familiar with you, your training style and your professional accolades.</p><p>Intro: You hold dual certification in dog training both with the Italian Association for Dog Trainers and Canine Consultants and you’re a certified CPDT-KA. So you’re no Mickey Mouse!!</p><p><br /></p><p>You’re also well published online on sites like:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>USA Today</li><li>Daily Puppy</li><li>Nest Pets</li></ul><p></p><p>And in print too in publications like:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Every Dog magazine</li><li>And the APDT Chronicle of the Dog.</li></ul><p></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Q: Could you briefly explain to the listeners what your certifications mean?</b></p><p></p><blockquote><p>Sure, I'll be glad to go over them! Well, it all started when I was visiting my family in Italy. I stumbled upon a program to become a certified dog trainer through the Italian Association for Dog Trainers and Canine Consultants.</p><p><br /></p><p>In order to get certified by this program I was required to attend several courses covering different disciplines. Such as canine conformation, ethology, evolution, kinetics and more.</p><p><br /></p><p>And then after passing a written test, I was mentored by a master dog trainer specializing in basic and advanced obedience for over 200 hours.</p><p><br /></p><p>After having fun training dogs for Canine Musical Freestlye that summer, I then returned back to the States and obtained Certification from the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers.</p><p><br /></p><p>This program entailed a minimum of 300 hours experience in dog training and passing a rigorous exam to demonstrate knowledge of humane, science-based dog training practices.</p><p><br /></p><p>The CPDT-KA intials after my name simply means that I am a Certified Professional Dog Trainer who's Knowledge has been Assessed by the CCPDT.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Q: Who inspired you to become an advocate for dogs and what events inspired you to become a professional dog trainer?</b></p><p></p><blockquote><p>To be totally honest, my dogs inspired me! When I got my dogs, I had no clue how challenging it was to raise two sibling puppies together. I guess I overestimated myself.</p><p><br /></p><p>I consulted with a few trainers and they told me I made a big mistake and that it was best to re-home one puppy as they would have grown too attached with each other and not pay any attention to me.</p><p><br /></p><p>I was determined to not let this suggestion discourage me, I already loved my pups and wanted to try anything in my power to overcome the problems, so I rolled up my sleeves and started reading and watching videos as much as I could and applying what I learned on a daily basis.</p><p><br /></p><p>I knew I must have been doing something right when people started asking me where I got my dogs trained and I told them I did it all myself.</p><p><br /></p><p>Soon, my husband's colleagues started asking me to the train their dogs and voice spread quickly and I immediately felt this was something I really enjoyed doing.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p>So many dog training programs follow the same structure; basic obedience, behavior modification and then a handful of the usual tricks like high five, roll over etc. But your approach with Brain Training for Dogs is unique in this regard. You place mental stimulation at the heart of your training program.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Q: Why is that? And what does this approach mean for dogs and owners?</b></p><blockquote><p>Well, the brain is something that never stops changing, it is constantly evolving and we need to provide it with constant challenges. Every time our dogs learn something new, new neural connections are formed. It is very fascinating!</p><p><br /></p><p>So my conclusion is that if we provide enough mental enrichment and keep those doggy brains thinking, dogs will by default become more receptive to being trained and more open to learning new skills.</p><p><br /></p><p>Their brains become more and more plastic, meaning they have a much easier time storing new information.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>I think Brain Training for Dogs is an exceptionally creative approach to dog training. And I’ve found with my dogs that it’s been a huge boost to their self-confidence and cemented a lot of great behaviors and manners in them.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Q: How did you come up with the idea?</b></p><blockquote><p>Well, the idea sort of evolved gradually. It mostly started with dogs coming over for board and training. Most of these dogs who suffered from behavior problems had something in common, they were lacking mental stimulation!</p><p><br /></p><p>Before even starting training or behavior modification, it greatly helped to exercise their body and mind with brain games so they were more receptive to learning.</p><p><br /></p><p>As a plus, these dogs were also building trust towards me so we had the perfect foundation to start working on the problems they were facing.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Q: Can you share a sneak peek into any plans that are in store for your Brain Training for Dogs in the future?</b></p><blockquote><p>Well, we have big plans coming up soon. On top of our popular e-books, we are creating an online library with a huge wealth of information for dog and puppy owners.</p><p><br /></p><p>The articles and videos in this library are going to tackle most problems dog owners face, with many tips and solutions.</p><p><br /></p><p>After completion, this “virtual library” will be available as a free bonus to all new customers, and the best part is that just like the “brain,” this library will keep on growing and evolving, with continuous additions and perks for dog owners!</p></blockquote><p></p><p>I hear a lot from dog owners on my blog who are experiencing perceived challenging behaviors with their dogs. In reality, many of these behaviors are normal. And with some training can easily be reconditioned. Things like; jumping, random barking, biting, leash pulling etc come up regularly.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Q: How can the focus on mental stimulation in Brain Training for Dogs help dogs and owners overcome these behaviors?</b></p><blockquote><p>It is often forgotten that before being companions, dogs were workers at heart. Dogs were pointing, flushing, retrieving, guarding livestock, and so forth for a good part of the day and nowadays most dogs are left unemployed with little to do.</p><p><br /></p><p>On top of that, dogs have a past history of being hunters and scavengers, so they are naturally wired to engage in behaviors such as digging, chewing and ripping things apart.</p><p><br /></p><p>When boredom sets in and when dogs are prevented from engaging in natural behaviors, dogs are forced to find their own sources of entertainment, but yikes! these forms of entertainment aren't very appealing to dog owners.</p><p><br /></p><p>With brain training we can provide dogs with outlets for their pent-up natural needs and provide them with “legit forms of entertainment” that won't upset dog owners.</p><p><br /></p><p>On top of that, being that owners are often involved in these brain games, dogs start perceiving their owners as part of the fun. It's a win-win!</p></blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p>Dog’s aren’t robots, they have their own personalities and minds to think. This can be easy to forget when training is not going according to plan. So, sticking with creativity here.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Q: What would you advise pooch parents to do to get creative when dog training isn’t going the way they want?</b></p><blockquote><p>I would say to think outside of the box. As you said, dogs are not robots so it may happen that you may stumble on some unusual problems that are not covered in any training book or training manual.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is why a cookie-cutter approach doesn't work in the field of dog training.</p><p><br /></p><p>If something isn't working, then it's time to troubleshoot the issue. Often it's just a matter of presenting the exercise in smaller, more attainable steps. Sometimes recording your trials and watching them carefully can help pinpoint the source of the problem.</p><p><br /></p><p>Other times, you just gotta get creative, try to take a stroll on the unbeaten path and see what happens, chances are you may stumble on the solution and be pleasantly surprised!</p></blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p>Your program, Brain Training for Dogs is currently the only online dog training program that is purely positive reinforcement. There are bunch of ‘balanced trainers’ who use a mix of positive and punishment in their training style. And of course many who subscribe to the dominance theory and punishment based training.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Q: What do you think is the reason that the dog training world just won’t let go of the dominance/punishment training style? When the reality is the results of this outdated training style are limited and poor at best.</b></p><blockquote><p>I think it's a matter of some people being stuck in the old ways of doing things which prevents them from evolving. The term “old school” reminds us that in the old days, children were hit on the hand with a wooden ruler.</p><p><br /></p><p>Fortunately, nowadays things have changed.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the dog training field, things are starting to change as well, but more work needs done. Fortunately, more and more studies are coming out and they support the use of positive reinforcement.</p><p><br /></p><p>More and more educated trainers are aware that interactions between dogs and their humans are not driven by social rank, but by a history of reinforcement.</p><p><br /></p><p>The dog therefore jumps not to attain higher rank, but to be closer to the owner, the dog pulls, not to be in charge of the walk, but to go sniff a bush, the dog steals the sandwich from the table not to challenge the owner but just because it tastes good.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is why it's important to find dog trainers who are continuing their education and understand the implications of using outdated techniques.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Q: What are the 4 most important things dog parents should NEVER do with or to their dogs?</b></p><blockquote><p>If I had to pick four I would say one is to avoid being inconsistent. Nothing confuses dogs more than being allowed to perform certain behaviors in a precise circumstance and then expect them not to perform them in another.</p><p><br /></p><p>Secondly, a pet peeve I have lately, is dog parents who leave collars on their dogs during play sessions with other dogs. It's very unfortunate, but there have been so many cases of death in dogs due to collar strangulation that could have been easily prevented.</p><p><br /></p><p>Third, I would advise to never train when frustration starts building up as this can cause dogs to shut down, when training requires dogs to be open.</p><p><br /></p><p>And of course, never engage in aversion-based methods such as giving alpha rolls, scruff shakes and all the alike. These will only inflict fear and intimidation and can trigger defensive aggression.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Q: What are the 4 best ways owners can build trust and bond with their dogs?</b></p><blockquote><p>Lack of trust is an issue I see a lot and it most often involves dogs who have been recently adopted from the shelter.</p><p><br /></p><p>Many dogs need time to adjust in their new surroundings and therefore I would recommend taking care in not overwhelming these dog with too many sights, sounds and smells at once. These dogs need time to assimilate and integrate themselves in the new home.</p><p><br /></p><p>Playing with dogs is a great way to bond. The 21 games I've included in my Brain Training for Dogs course offer owners a great chance to play and bond with their dogs while teaching their dogs new skills at the same time.</p><p><br /></p><p>Training can also be a great confidence booster for insecure dogs. Targeting, nosework and agility obstacles are all great ways for dogs to bond and build trust in their owners. I've been sure to include all 3 of these in the Brain Training for Dogs course.</p><p><br /></p><p>Last but not least, I would encourage dog owners to take steps to make their dogs feel safe. Dogs need to learn that their owner will be there to protect them and avoid putting them into overwhelming situations. Many dogs feel relief when they feel that they have their owners to rely on as advocates for their safety and wellbeing.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p>I recently had an email from a dog owner who wants to make the switch from punishment based training (he’s used shock collars, alpha rolls and flooding to name a few techniques) to positive reinforcement.</p><p><br /></p><p>Understandably, this guy feels a deep sense of regret. And concern that from his dog’s perspective the trust is gone and that there is no chance of fixing what’s been broken.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Q: Is it possible to make the switch in the dog’s mind from one of being afraid to explore behaviors (and possibly afraid of the owner too) and performing out of fear to one of openness like you mentioned earlier?</b></p><p></p><blockquote><p>Absolutely! And the change is one of the most rewarding experiences dog owners get to witness with their dogs. Of course, the process takes time, but as days unfold, tentative dogs starting coming out of their shell and the changes are quite remarkable.</p><p><br /></p><p>In particular, clicker training and free-shaping – which are both covered in the Brain Training for Dogs course – create a great foundation for tentative dogs in need of learning to offer new behaviors and transform them into enthusiastic learners.</p><p><br /></p><p>And the best part of all, the increased trust and bonding that results as a”side effect” from these methods is the greatest perk for dog owners.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Q: As an expert, what do you think dog parents find the most challenging? And what fixes do you suggest?</b></p><p></p><blockquote><p>Well, one big obstacle is the fact that many dog parents have a hard time accepting that changes take time, they do not happen overnight.</p><p><br /></p><p>Pet parents are often looking for quick fixes and often have unrealistic expectations. I had a client ask me once, “I would like my dog to stay in my non-fenced yard in the morning and be there in the exact spot when I come back from work, what can I do?”</p><p><br /></p><p>I told him I had the perfect solution: to stop by the closest garden center and pick a statue of a dog.” I then left him a business card of several fencing companies and fortunately, last time I drove by, I noticed he was getting a fence installed.</p><p><br /></p><p>The fix for this is therefore to understand that dogs are animals, it requires time to change behavior, but with patience, determination and consistency, you can accomplish a whole lot.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p>Dog training is also about training humans and sometimes we humans need the most training! And in your career you’ve worked with countless pooches and their owners.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Q: What do you find most challenging when training humans?</b></p><p></p><blockquote><p>Hmm, that's a good question! I think something I encounter over and over is reminding pet parents to get into the mind of the dog and refraining from putting labels on their dogs. I hear too often things like ” oh my dog is so stubborn” oh, my dog is so vicious..”</p><p><br /></p><p>These labels only hurt people's relationships with their dogs because they imply the belief that dogs cannot change because the labels reflect a dog's essence.</p><p><br /></p><p>It is far more productive looking beyond these labels and trying to understand exactly what triggers dogs to behave in certain ways and what can be done about it.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Q: </b>As more studies about dogs are done, we realize we still have a lot to learn about our canine friends. As a professional dog trainer and behavior specialist, where would you like to see more scientific research done? And where do you see dog training 10 years from now?</p><p></p><blockquote><p>There has been an increased interest in studying dogs lately, which is great! I would love to see more studies on dog cognition, discovering more about the dog's brain and how it works. Like recently there was a study that researched how dogs process what we say, and the results showed that they perceive words in a similar fashion as human brains do.</p><p><br /></p><p>As more of these studies on dog cognition and neuroscience come out,demonstrating how dogs analyze and interpret the information we present to them, and how dogs perceive the world around them, dog training will continue to evolve as well to reflect these results. This is why training dogs is one of those disciplines that is never static, you never stop learning and you will always have to keep up with the new data. It's very, very fascinating.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Signing off.</b></p><p>Adrienne, thank you so much for taking the time to give us to get to know you better.
